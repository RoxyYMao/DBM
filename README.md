## Database Management
### Project Purposes
The purpose of the project is to experience developing a working database for analytics, conducting ETL to load the data, writing SQL queries and visualizing the results.
These data are from Medicare Shared Savings Program (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) and is provided to us by Bon Secours. 

### Aim and Thesis of the Project

The United States has the largest health care expenditure as a percentage of GDP. While
the powerful monetary pull of medicine does have its advantages, The U.S. leads the world's
success rates in many elective and complex cancer surgeries; the healthcare system is positioned
precariously with high drug costs and some of the highest readmission rates1.

Our group used readmission rate as a starting block for our analysis; readmission rate is
both an indicator of poor patient outcomes and unnecessary stress on health care. The data
provided by Bon Secours was instrumental in gaining insight into the Hampton Roads and
Richmond areas.

Virginia has exceptional levels of readmission. It nears the top ten states with the highest
readmission percentage(). Before scuttling through the data, Virginia's high readmission rates
blended one of our original theories on thoughts on leading causes. Obesity, high blood pressure,
and other examples of pre-existing conditions were what shaped our original thesis. However,
Virginia is not one of the most obese states, nor does it struggle with heart failure at a level than
its southern neighbors.

After further sifting through the data, we began to select criteria useful for further analysis:
benefit type, mortality rate, individual age, and varying diagnostic information. We constructed
our two main aims, identifying a problem and deciding how best to intervene: better public
benefits need to be put in place, so individuals visit primary care physicians instead of hospitals
as a first and only resort. Additionally, many diseases people in the TideWater area were dying
from are preventable, and people who did not have access to a Primary Care physician suffered a
disproportionately low survival rate.
